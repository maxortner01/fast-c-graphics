Object creation is not entirely self-contained. That is to say, creating a surface does not completely finish the creation process (hence why the `FCG_CreateRenderEnvironment` is the ideal way to create objects). This is because in order to create a surface, the render api information is needed, that is (for Vulkan) an instance is needed. But this is only done once `FCG_Machine` is initialized. So, `FCG_InitializeMachine` actually finishes the initialization of the given `FCG_Surface`.

This puts the order of destruction out of wack, though, since `FCG_Surface` *should* be destroyed after `FCG_Machine`, but the destruction of the instance occurs in the latter. Thus, the need for the stack of destructors arises. This way, `FCG_InitializeMachine` can push the destruction of objects that `FCG_Surface` might contain.
